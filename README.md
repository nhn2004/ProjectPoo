# Project: Vehicle Purchase and Sale System
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Partial Project

## Project Description
This project is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the buying and selling of vehicles. The system includes three main classes: `Moto`, `Auto`, and `Camioneta`. The project enables interaction between buyers and sellers, providing a seamless experience for vehicle transactions.

## Key Features
- **Vehicle Classes:** The system includes three distinct vehicle classes:
  - `Moto`: Represents motorcycles with specific attributes and methods.
  - `Auto`: Represents cars with specific attributes and methods.
  - `Camioneta`: Represents pickup trucks with specific attributes and methods.
- **User Interaction:** Facilitates communication and transactions between buyers and sellers.
- **Inventory Management:** Keeps track of available vehicles for sale and updates the inventory as transactions occur.
- **Search and Filter:** Allows users to search for vehicles based on various criteria such as type, price range, and model.
- **Transaction Handling:** Manages the details of buying and selling vehicles, including price negotiation and finalization of sales.

## Objectives
- To create a user-friendly application that simplifies the process of buying and selling vehicles.
- To provide a robust system that accurately represents different types of vehicles with appropriate attributes and methods.
- To ensure smooth and efficient interaction between buyers and sellers.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Design and implementation of the `Moto`, `Auto`, and `Camioneta` classes.
- **GUI Framework:** (If applicable, specify the GUI framework used, e.g., Swing, JavaFX)

## How It Works
1. **Vehicle Listings:** Sellers can list their vehicles for sale by providing details such as type, model, year, and price.
2. **Search and Filter:** Buyers can search for vehicles using various filters to find the best match for their needs.
3. **View Details:** Buyers can view detailed information about each vehicle, including specifications and seller contact information.
4. **Transaction:** Once a buyer is interested in a vehicle, they can initiate contact with the seller to negotiate and finalize the sale.
5. **Inventory Updates:** The system automatically updates the inventory once a transaction is completed.

## Expected Outcomes
- A streamlined process for buying and selling vehicles.
- Enhanced user experience through intuitive search and filter options.
- Accurate and detailed representation of different vehicle types.
- Increased efficiency in managing vehicle inventory and transactions.

## Team Contributions
- **Class Design and Implementation:** Development of the `Moto`, `Auto`, and `Camioneta` classes with appropriate attributes and methods.
- **User Interface:** Creation of an intuitive and user-friendly interface for buyers and sellers.
- **Transaction Management:** Implementation of features to handle vehicle transactions and inventory updates.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the vehicle buying and selling process. By leveraging object-oriented programming principles and a user-centric design, the system ensures an efficient and enjoyable experience for both buyers and sellers.
